Spotify could use the data from these queries in their Spotify Wrapped campaign to provide users with feedback about their listening habits.
Users could get the top 5 longest songs they listened to, songs by certain artists they listened to such as Post Malone/Drake, or songs that featured multiple artists.
This information provides additional value to customers and helps them get the most out of the platform.
Additionally, these queries can be slightly modified to provide even more.
